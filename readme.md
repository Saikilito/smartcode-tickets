# The Project

The project consists of an application that discriminates between administrators and users, between them they can request tickets but only the adrministrator can edit users, edit, delete tickets and even other users.

Based in these requirements

- You must create an app in React + nodejs+ MySql(or other) in which you can register and log in **(without password recovery)** and in which there are two user profiles: Administrator and User.
- The administrator profile has only one table to manage tickets (Crud) where they can be assigned to users.
- The user profile only has a list of tickets assigned to it and a button to request them (set the order_ticket).
- The users login must discriminate and redirect according to their profile.

- The project has 3 Tables:

1. usuarios: id, id_tipouser, nombre, mail, pass
2. ticket: id , id_user , ticket_pedido
3. tipo_usuario: id, nombre

- Async calls to external server
- Object Oriented Programming
- ES6 syntax
- Export/import ES6+ notation
