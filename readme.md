# The Project

The project consists of an application that discriminates between administrators and users, between them they can request tickets but only the adrministrator can edit users, edit, delete tickets and even other users.

Based in these requirements

- You must create an app in React + nodejs+ MySql(or other) in which you can register and log in **(without password recovery)** and in which there are two user profiles: Administrator and User.
- The administrator profile has only one table to manage tickets (Crud) where they can be assigned to users.
- The user profile only has a list of tickets assigned to it and a button to request them (set the order_ticket).
- The users login must discriminate and redirect according to their profile.

- The project has 3 Tables:

1. usuarios: id, id_tipouser, nombre, mail, pass
2. ticket: id , id_user , ticket_pedido
3. tipo_usuario: id, nombre

- Async calls to external server
- Object Oriented Programming
- ES6 syntax
- Export/import ES6+ notation

# Features

- Basic VanillaJS app with a single script or few commands
- ReactJS Framework
- Nodejs based on typescript
- TypeORM ORM for connect a Mysql
- connected an API using `async/await`
- Bootstrap 4
- JWT Authorization (routes protected and login token)
- Mobile Optimized

# Built With

- Create React App (CRA)
- React-Router-Dom
- `yarn`
- `vscode` with prettier extension
- Windows 10

## Prerequisites

- `yarn` 1.21.1 +

- `mysql +8.0`
- A Text Editor like VSCode
- A browser like Firefox or Chrome

## Quick Start

Please follow carefully the following steps

1 - In your Mysql create and use a new database (smartcode or any database name)

```bash
create database smartcode;
use database smartcode;
```

2 - git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saikilito/smartcode-tickets.git
```

3- Inside the server folder write an .env file with the necessary data to connect to the local database, use the .env.example file to guide you

```bash
cd smartcode-tickets/server
```

```bash
USERNAME_DB =
PASSWORD_DB =
DB_NAME =
JWT_SECRET =
```

4- install and run server

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

5- insert initial data necessary in your MySql database (TypeORM created the tables and relations for you with you ran the server )

```bash
insert into tipo_usuario (nombre) values ("admin");
insert into tipo_usuario (nombre) values ("user");
```

6- install and run client

```bash
cd smartcode-tickets/client
yarn && yarn start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the client app.
And use [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) for interact with the server
